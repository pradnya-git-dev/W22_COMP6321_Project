# W22_COMP6321_Project

Steps to run the notebook (W22_COMP6321_Project.ipynb):

1. Please ensure the following files are present in the same working directory as the notebook:
   1. "W22_COMP6321_Project.ipynb"
   2. "requirements.txt"
   3. "test_dataset_processed.csv"
   4. "train_dataset_processed.csv"

2. The following link can be used to access the models we saved while working on the project: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FV9txga3GGvbpD7t0aA04d08N26Kg7W3?usp=sharing
   1. Please ensure that the entire "best_models" directory from this link is copied in the same directory as the notebook to be able to use these models to directly evaluate their performances.
   2. Adding this folder is not required to run the code in the project notebook. And a new "best_models" directory will be created automatically if one is not detected.
   3. However, adding this directory will help in verifying the performance of saved models.
